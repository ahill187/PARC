Graph Theory & Community Detection
**********************************

For an overview of graph theory and terminology, see the :ref:`community_detection` section.
This is recommended reading before diving into the details of the algorithms.

Background: Relevant Algorithms
********************************

The PARC algorithm uses two key algorithms: the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm
and the Leiden algorithm. The Leiden algorithm, in turn, is based on the Louvain method. In this
section, we discuss these three algorithms in more detail:

- :ref:`hnsw_algorithm`
- :ref:`louvain_method`
- :ref:`leiden_algorithm`

PARC Algorithm
***************

The PARC algorithm is a graph clustering algorithm that is used to find communities in a graph.
See the :ref:`parc_algorithm` section for more details.
