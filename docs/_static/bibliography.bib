    abstract = "{New single-cell technologies continue to fuel the explosive growth in the scale of
        heterogeneous single-cell data. However, existing computational methods are inadequately
        scalable to large datasets and therefore cannot uncover the complex cellular heterogeneity.
        We introduce a highly scalable graph-based clustering algorithm PARC—Phenotyping by
        Accelerated Refined Community-partitioning—for large-scale, high-dimensional single-cell
        data (\&gt;1 million cells). Using large single-cell flow and mass cytometry, RNA-seq and
        imaging-based biophysical data, we demonstrate that PARC consistently outperforms
        state-of-the-art clustering algorithms without subsampling of cells, including Phenograph,
        FlowSOM and Flock, in terms of both speed and ability to robustly detect rare cell
        populations. For example, PARC can cluster a single-cell dataset of 1.1 million cells
        within 13 min, compared with \&gt;2 h for the next fastest graph-clustering algorithm.
        Our work presents a scalable algorithm to cope with increasingly large-scale
        single-cell analysis.https://github.com/ShobiStassen/PARC.
